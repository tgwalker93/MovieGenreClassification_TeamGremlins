Der Unfallchirurg Thomas Reiter zieht sich freiwillig in eine geschlossene Anstalt zurück, weil er sich dem Alltag nicht mehr stellen will. Probleme löst er in seiner Vorstellung - einer Western-Phantasie. Ein Pfarrer wird von seinen besorgten Eltern beauftragt, ihren Sohn in die Wirklichkeit zurückzuholen. Als Thomas ihn auffordert, ihm in seine Welt des Westerns zu folgen, erkennt der Pfarrer, daß diese Realitätsflucht nicht frei von Faszination ist... Eine humoristische Betrachtung von Wirklichkeit und Vorstellung, ein Film über die Auflösung von Grenzen. "Da hat also jemand Schwierigkeiten mit seinem Leben und flüchtet sich in eine einfache Welt. Natürlich könnte ich als Drehbuchautor in so einem Fall auch sagen, er flüchtet sich in Videospiele - aber das war mir alles zu banal, das lag zu sehr auf der Hand. Der Western steht ja auch für etwas, er steht für Vereinfachung. Es gibt Gut und es gibt Böse, also ziemlich klare Richtlinien. Für mich war das der klarste Sprung für einen, dem die Realität zu komplex ist. Zusätzlich war es natürlich ein enormer Anreiz, gerade in einem Land, wo es keine Infrastruktur für einen Western gibt, ernsthaft zu versuchen, einen zu machen. Dennoch: WANTED ist auf jeden Fall kein Western. Das ist ganz wichtig. Der Western ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Films, ein Viertel vielleicht, wo eine bestimmte Wunschvorstellung bedient wird. Alles andere ist ganz real. Für mich ist es eine Komödie, aber ich kann auch über Dinge lachen, die andere gar nicht lustig finden. Sagen wir so: Wenn INDIEN eine Komödie war, dann ist WANTED auch eine." - drama

Off the Western most coast of Australia is a secret location known to only a very few people, and around 5000 humpback whales. It's a special place. It's a magic place. It's a place where humpbacks come to mate, to give birth and to teach their young how to survive. This nursery has only just been discovered by humanity, though the whales have known about it for millennium. The people who discovered this place are Curt and Mich Jenner a husband a wife scientific team who run the Australian Centre for Whale Research. They live on the research vessel WhaleSong with their 3 year old daughter Micah. In WhaleSong the Jenners take us to this, the humpback bedroom, as they and Earthwatch volunteers study pregnant and nursing humpbacks, with the hope of seeing something which has never been seen before, the birth of a humpback whale. WhaleSong is a celebration of the humpback whale. In this programme we see unique behavioural footage never before filmed. We see two huge 50 feet humpbacks gently playing in seaweed, or rather making love in the seaweed. Finding the weed somewhat sensual the pair roll around in it for hours. The Jenners have been studying humpbacks for 10 years and say they have never seen anything like this before. We also followed a mother and two-week-old calf. Amazing scenes as we witness her teaching her calf how to fluke slap, how to slap its pectoral fin and the most breathtaking of all, how to breach (to jump out of the water). Other unique footage includes a pregnant cow in labour. The incredible thing about this is she was hanging upside down, almost as if she was hanging by her tail; she was with an escort. At first it was thought this escort was a midwife, but then the boat started to vibrate as the huge whale below began to sing. Accepted wisdom has it that only males sing. Accepted wisdom has it that only females act as midwives. So was this escort a singing female or a male helping out? This potentially will re-write the textbooks. Another amazing and very rare sight - a mega-pod of eight whales, seven of whom were males. Humpbacks are solitary animals and are rarely seen in-groups larger than two or three. As already stated this area is a nursery. These seven males however cared not for the pregnant females or the newborn learning how to survive. Like a gang of bikies they tore through the area churning up the sea and "singing up a storm" with their competing whale songs trying to attract a mate. Rambunctious males aren't the main threat to baby humpbacks, we see a 5.5 metre white pointer shark attacking and eating a one tonne sea lion. But the main threat to these whales is humanity and in WhaleSong the scientists call for this pristine area to be declared a sanctuary for future generations of humpbacks. - documentary

There was a time, when over 20,000 wolves roamed Ireland. As super predators they are a natural part of the landscape and ecosystem and are deeply embedded in many of our famous myths and legends. In this documentary series, Dr. Éamonn Ó Ciardha looks at our complex relationship with the Wolf, taking us on a hair raising journey into Ireland's past, exploring the background to what many of us experience as an instinctive fear of the Wolf or Mac Tíre - son of the land. A land that was in increasing turmoil at the turn of the 16th century as plantation settlers began to arrive. For them, the wolf became a fearsome symbol of this wild and dangerous land. Large-scale farming and deforestation saw the wolf rapidly losing its hunting and breeding grounds. But war, rebellion and fighting between settlers and a growing number of Irish rebels provided rich pickings for wolves who would scavenge on the fallen. The terrified settlers called their new home "Wolfland". The first programme in the series looks at the traces and tracks the wolf has left with us in Ireland, within the landscape and place names, the language, the literature and the mythology. Roaming the land for some 20,000 years the wolf was certainly feared, but also revered in Ireland. It was a creature that symbolised strength and courage to the native Irish, but to the arriving settlers from the 16th century onwards the wolf was a dark and savage creature representing all that needed tamed. Filmed across Ireland, this series is a mix of Irish history and natural history, charting the importance of the wolf in Ireland's history and its ultimate extinction. - documentary

Receiving an urgent letter from his father to return home, Tom Duncan arrives to find him murdered. When his servant and then his sidekick disappear, Tom sees a masked stranger leaving the ranch and chases him. But the stranger's men are waiting and Tom soon finds himself a prisoner. Grouchy old rancher John Duncan has hidden $50,000 and is writing a note telling of its hiding place, but is murdered by a mysterious cloaked intruder known as The Phantom, before he can finish the line..."if you will follow...". His son Tom Duncan with his pal Windy comes to town seeking revenge on the killer of his father. He has several suspects---ranch foreman Scarface; ranch cook Sing Fat; lawyer Burt Hartecker and neighboring rancher Tap Smiley, who didn't like the father and likes the son even less because he is trifling around (or something) with Tap's daughter, Nancy. But a couple of them disappear, possibly---it's hard to tell since most of the film contains the most confused editing continuity in the history of B-westerns and the 5th worse bar fight in the genre (the first four occur in Victor Adamson films). Sing Fat is the most obvious red herring, especially after he poisons a dog for no apparent reason since he isn't the killer and didn't poison the old man afterwards anyway. To find the money, follow the matches. Sing Fat is smirking around at the end indicating he thinks there is still a reel to go. This was remade as an entry in Monogram's Range Busters' series as "Saddle Mountain Roundup" but "Big Boy Rides Again" writer William L. Nolte, serving as production manager of "Saddle Mountain Roundup", wisely chose to let writers Earl Snell and John Vlahos take the blame on the remake. - western

The first 1933 - 1978 starts with the Zionist movement and ends with the first re-visitation of that history. The second 1978 - 2005 starts at the beginning of the political wave until the more recent personal cinema. However chronological, both episodes cover most of the genres, themes and periods of Israeli cinema - from the beginning of the Zionist Mouvement to the most personal stories - from commercial to politically engaged directors, from the local to the universal. A HISTORY OF ISRAELI CINEMA tells the story of the building of a gaze on a society torn by ethnics, religious, and political conflicts. It attempts to understand, to denounce or to explore this complex subjects, always searching for the right ethic, the right form: to explore or transform its own definition and its place in the world. A History of Israeli Cinema is the result of years of researches, studies, documentation, screening, interviews, some recorded, some to learn, to understand, to unfold. Actors, thinkers, producers, filmmakers, professors, critics negotiated to build a narrative that remains fragile and incomplete. It is the process rather than the result that is shared here. - documentary
